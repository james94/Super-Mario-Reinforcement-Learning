# Resources on Super Mario Reinforcement Learning

In my research to create a super mario machine learning application that uses reinforcement learning to play the games, I found these articles helpful:

- [Using Reinforcement Learning to play Super Mario Bros on NES using TensorFlow](https://www.statworx.com/at/blog/using-reinforcement-learning-to-play-super-mario-bros-on-nes-using-tensorflow/)
- [Getting Mario Back into the Gym: Setting up Super Mario Bros. in OpenAIâ€™s gym](https://becominghuman.ai/getting-mario-back-into-the-gym-setting-up-super-mario-bros-in-openais-gym-8e39a96c1e41)
- [Super Mario Bros. Bot with Reinforcement Learning](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/super-mario-bros-reinforcement-learning-77d6615a805e)
- [Teaching Your Computer To Play Super Mario Bros. - A Fork of Google DeepMind Atari Machine Learning Project](https://www.ehrenbrav.com/2016/08/teaching-your-computer-to-play-super-mario-bros-a-fork-of-the-google-deepmind-atari-machine-learning-project/)

I also found these github repos helpful:

- [mario-ai](https://github.com/aleju/mario-ai)
- [Super Mario Reinforcement Learning from Demonstration](https://github.com/wenkesj/mario)

I also found these publications helpful:

- [Super Mario Bros Game Playing with Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs221/cs221.1192/2018/restricted/posters/xwan/poster.pdf)
